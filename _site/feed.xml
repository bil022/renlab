				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract&lt;/b&gt;: 
Loss of heterochromatin has been implicated as a cause of pre-mature aging and age-associated decline in organ functions in mammals; however, the specific cell types and gene loci affected by this type of epigenetic change have remained unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we probed chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution in the brains, hearts, skeletal muscles, and bone marrows from young, middle-aged, and old mice, and assessed age-associated changes at 353,126 candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) across 32 major cell types. Unexpectedly, we detected increased chromatin accessibility within specific heterochromatin domains in old mouse excitatory neurons. The gain of chromatin accessibility at these genomic loci was accompanied by the cell-type-specific loss of heterochromatin and activation of LINE1 elements. Immunostaining further confirmed the loss of the heterochromatin mark H3K9me3 in the excitatory neurons but not in inhibitory neurons or glial cells. Our results reveal the cell-type-specific changes in chromatin landscapes in old mice and shed light on the scope of heterochromatin loss in mammalian aging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract&lt;/b&gt;: 
Current catalogs of regulatory sequences in the human genome are still incomplete and lack cell type resolution. To profile the activity of gene regulatory elements in diverse cell types and tissues in the human body, we applied single-cell chromatin accessibility assays to 30 adult human tissue types from multiple donors. We integrated these datasets with previous single-cell chromatin accessibility data from 15 fetal tissue types to reveal the status of open chromatin for ∼1.2 million candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in 222 distinct cell types comprised of &amp;gt;1.3 million nuclei. We used these chromatin accessibility maps to delineate cell-type-specificity of fetal and adult human cCREs and to systematically interpret the noncoding variants associated with complex human traits and diseases. This rich resource provides a foundation for the analysis of gene regulatory programs in human cell types across tissues, life stages, and organ systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract&lt;/b&gt;: 
The mammalian cerebrum performs high level sensory, motor control and cognitive functions through highly specialized cortical networks and subcortical nuclei. Recent surveys of mouse and human brains with single cell transcriptomics and high-throughput imaging technologies have uncovered hundreds of neuronal cell types and a variety of non-neuronal cell types distributed in different brain regions, but the cell-type-specific transcriptional regulatory programs responsible for the unique identity and function of each brain cell type have yet to be elucidated. Here, we probe the accessible chromatin in &amp;gt;800,000 individual nuclei from 45 regions spanning the adult mouse isocortex, olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cerebral nuclei, and use the resulting data to define 491,818 candidate cis regulatory DNA elements in 160 distinct sub-types. We link a significant fraction of them to putative target genes expressed in diverse cerebral cell types and uncover transcriptional regulators involved in a broad spectrum of molecular and cellular pathways in different neuronal and glial cell populations. Our results provide a foundation for comprehensive analysis of gene regulatory programs of the mammalian brain and assist in the interpretation of non-coding risk variants associated with various neurological disease and traits in humans. To facilitate the dissemination of information, we have set up a web portal (http://catlas.org/mousebrain).&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract&lt;/b&gt;: 
Single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) analysis has been increasingly used to map chromatin architecture in diverse tissue contexts, but computational tools to define chromatin loops at high resolution from scHi-C data are still lacking. Here, we describe Single-Nucleus Analysis Pipeline for Hi-C (SnapHiC), a method that can identify chromatin loops at high resolution and accuracy from scHi-C data. Using scHi-C data from 742 mouse embryonic stem cells, we benchmark SnapHiC against a number of computational tools developed for mapping chromatin loops and interactions from bulk Hi-C. We further demonstrate its use by analyzing single-nucleus methyl-3C-seq data from 2,869 human prefrontal cortical cells, which uncovers cell type-specific chromatin loops and predicts putative target genes for noncoding sequence variants associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Our results indicate that SnapHiC could facilitate the analysis of cell type-specific chromatin architecture and gene regulatory programs in complex tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract&lt;/b&gt;: 
Insulators play a critical role in spatiotemporal gene regulation in animals. The evolutionarily conserved CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is required for insulator function in mammals, but not all of its binding sites act as insulators. Here we explore the sequence requirements of CTCF-mediated transcriptional insulation using a sensitive insulator reporter in mouse embryonic stem cells. We find that insulation potency depends on the number of CTCF-binding sites in tandem. Furthermore, CTCF-mediated insulation is dependent on upstream flanking sequences at its binding sites. CTCF-binding sites at topologically associating domain boundaries are more likely to function as insulators than those outside topologically associating domain boundaries, independently of binding strength. We demonstrate that insulators form local chromatin domain boundaries and weaken enhancer–promoter contacts. Taken together, our results provide genetic, molecular and structural evidence connecting chromatin topology to the action of insulators in the mammalian genome.&lt;/p&gt;
