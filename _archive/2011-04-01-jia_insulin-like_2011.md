    abstract: " OBJECTIVE: To study the interaction between insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TRalpha1) and the modulatory effect of IGFBP-3 on transcription of the thyroid hormone responsive gene. METHODS: The interaction between IGFBP-3 and TRalpha1 was detected with glutathione-S-transferase pull-down method, co-immunoprecipitation, fluorescence  resonance energy transfer test. The cellular distribution of these two proteins was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The effect of IGFBP-3 on the  growth hormone promoter activity stimulated by triiodothyronine (T3) was determined by dual-luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: IGFBP-3 interacted with TRalpha1 both in vivo and in vitro. IGFBP-3 and TRalpha1 were shown to co-localize in the nucleus of HEK-293 cells. The overexpressed IGFBP-3 inhibited  the growth hormone promoter activity stimulated by T3 (Ptextless0.01). CONCLUSIONS:,"
