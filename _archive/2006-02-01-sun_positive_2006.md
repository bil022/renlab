    abstract: " Both malignant and normal prostate epithelial cells produce endothelin-1 (ET-1),  a critical factor in prostate cancer (CaP) progression. beta-Catenin (beta-cat),  a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, is also implicated in CaP progression via beta-cat/T cell factor (Tcf) signaling. We recently demonstrated  that beta-cat/Tcf-4 regulates transcription of ET-1 in colon cancer cells. In the present study, we found that Tcf-4 specifically bound to and activated the ET-1 promoter in vivo in human CaP cells and mouse prostate tissue. Expression of ET-1 in DU145 CaP cells was down-regulated by knocking down endogenous beta-cat or Tcf-4. Ectopic activation of beta-cat/Tcf-4 signaling significantly elevated expression of ET-1 in LNCaP cells. In addition, genetic ablation of beta-cat significantly inhibited transcription of ET-1 in primary prostate epithelial cells. Meanwhile, exogenous ET-1 enhanced beta-cat/Tcf signaling and ET-1 expression in DU145 cells, which was blocked by both selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor,"
