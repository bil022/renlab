    abstract: " Pneumococcal surface protein (PspA) is a virulence factor expressed by all clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. PspAs are variable in structure and have been grouped into clades and cross-reacting families based on sequence similarities and immunologic cross-reactivity. At least 98% of PspAs are found in PspA families 1 or 2. PspA has been shown to interfere with complement deposition on pneumococci, thus reducing opsonization and clearance of bacteria by the host  immune system. Prior studies using pooled human sera have shown that PspA interferes with C3 deposition on a single strain of S. pneumoniae, WU2, and that  mouse antibody to PspA can enhance the deposition of C3 on WU2. The present studies have demonstrated that these previous findings are representative of most normal human sera and each of seven different strains of S. pneumoniae. It was observed that PspAs of PspA families 1 and 2 could inhibit C3 deposition in the presence of immunoglobulin present in all but 3 of 22 normal human sera. These studies have also demonstrated that rabbit and human antibody to PspA can enhance the deposition of C3 on pneumococci expressing either family 1 or 2 PspAs and either capsular types 2, 3, or 11. A vaccine candidate that can elicit immunity that neutralizes or compensates for S. pneumoniae's ability to thwart host immunity would be of value.,"
