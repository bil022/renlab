    abstract: " To develop a molecular probe for MRI detection of human tumor telomerase reverse  transcriptase (hTERT) mRNA expression. Uniformly phosphorothioate-modified hTERT  antisense oligonucleotide (ASON) homing hTERT mRNA was labeled with gadolinium (Gd) through the bifunctional chelator 1,4,7, 10-tetraazacyclododecane-N, N', N'', N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) stirred within 45 minutes at 60 degrees C. The  Gd labeled probes were characterized in vitro. The cellular uptake rate and biodistribution of (99m) Tc-DOTA-ASON was measured instead of that of Gd-DOTA-ASON. A549 lung adenocarcinoma model was established in BALB/c nude mice  and Gd-DOTA-ASON was injected intraperitoneally and MR images were acquired using 7.0T Micro-MRI (Bruker Biospec, Ettlingen, Germany) at different time points. Immunohistochemical analysis of telomerase activity of each xenograft was operated two days after in vivo imaging. The binding efficiency of Gd-DOTA-ASON reached as high as 71.7 +/- 4.5% (n "
