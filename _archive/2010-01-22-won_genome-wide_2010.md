    abstract: " We present an integrated method called Chromia for the genome-wide identification of functional target loci of transcription factors. Designed to capture the characteristic patterns of transcription factor binding motif occurrences and the histone profiles associated with regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers, Chromia significantly outperforms other methods in the identification  of 13 transcription factor binding sites in mouse embryonic stem cells, evaluated by both binding (ChIP-seq) and functional (RNA interference knockdown) experiments.,"
