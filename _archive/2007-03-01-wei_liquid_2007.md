    abstract: " A sensitive and selective liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric (LC-MS) method for the determination of venlafaxine in human plasma has been developed. Samples were prepared using liquid-liquid extraction and analyzed on a C(18) column interfaced with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Positive electrospray ionization was employed as the ionization source. The mobile phase was methanol-water containing 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate, pH 7.9 adjusted with aqueous ammonia (80:20, v/v) at the flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The analyte and internal standard clozapine were both detected by use of selected ion monitoring  mode. The method was linear in the concentration range of 1.0-200.0 ng/mL. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 1.0 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-day relative standard deviation across three validation runs over the entire concentration range was less than 10.1%. The accuracy determined at three concentrations (5.0, 50.0 and 150.0 ng/mL for venlafaxine) was within +/-10.0% in terms of relative error (RE). The method was successfully applied for the evaluation of pharmacokinetic profiles of venlafaxine capsule in 20 healthy volunteers. The results show AUC, T(max), C(max) and T(1/2) between the testing formulation and reference formulation have no significant difference (p textgreater 0.05).  Relative bioavailability was 103.4 +/- 14.1%.,"
