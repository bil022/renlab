    abstract: " ChIP-chip combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with microarrays (chip) to determine protein-DNA interactions occurring in living cells. The high throughput nature of this method makes it an ideal approach for identifying transcription factor targets or chromatin modification sites along the genome. UNIT 21.9 describes a protocol for analysis of protein-DNA interactions in yeast  cells. This unit introduces an alternative protocol developed for mammalian cells.,"
