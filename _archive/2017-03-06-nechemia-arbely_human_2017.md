    abstract: " Chromatin assembled with centromere protein A (CENP-A) is the epigenetic mark of  centromere identity. Using new reference models, we now identify sites of CENP-A  and histone H3.1 binding within the megabase, alpha-satellite repeat-containing centromeres of 23 human chromosomes. The overwhelming majority (97%) of alpha-satellite DNA is found to be assembled with histone H3.1-containing nucleosomes with wrapped DNA termini. In both G1 and G2 cell cycle phases, the,"
