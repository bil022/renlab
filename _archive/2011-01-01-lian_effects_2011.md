    abstract: " AIM: To study the effect of the minocycline (MNC) on expression of bcl-2, bax in  retinal nerve cells of rat with diabetes. METHODS: Male SD rats were randomly divided into negative control group, model control group and MNC treated group. Diabetes model was established by intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ). The protein expressions of bcl-2 and bax in retina were detected by immunohistochemistry method. RESULTS: Compared with the negative control group, bax immunoreactive neurons in retina were increased significantly  (Ptextless0.01) in model control group. However, bax immunoreactive neurons in retina in MNC treated group were significantly decreased (Ptextless0.01). Compared with the model  control group, bcl-2 immunoreactive neurons in retina were increased significantly(Ptextless0.01) in MNC treated group. CONCLUSION: MNC can obviously decreased expression of bax and increased expression of bcl-2 in retina with DR.  It is one of path of inhibiting impairment on retinal nerve cells with DR.,"
