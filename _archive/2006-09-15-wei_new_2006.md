    abstract: " Based on the stochastic resonance theory, a new single-well potential stochastic  resonance algorithm (SSR) to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is presented. In the new algorithm, stochastic resonance takes place in a single-well potential driven only by the noise. The effect on the proposed algorithm is discussed. By using simulated and experimental data sets, it is proven that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the weak signal can be greatly enhanced by this method. The new single-well potential stochastic resonance algorithm (SSR) may be a promising tool to extend instrumental linear range and to improve the accuracy of trace analysis. The research enlarges the application  scope of single-well potential to nonlinear signal processing.,"
