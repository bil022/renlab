    abstract: " Pol II(G) is a distinct form of RNA polymerase II that contains the tightly associated Gdown1 polypeptide (encoded by POLR2M). Unlike Pol II, Pol II(G) is highly dependent upon Mediator for robust activator-dependent transcription in a  biochemically defined in vitro system. Here, in vitro studies show that Gdown1 competes with TFIIF for binding to the RPB1 and RPB5 subunits of Pol II, thereby  inhibiting an essential function of TFIIF in preinitiation complex assembly, but  also that Mediator can actually facilitate Pol II(G) binding to the promoter prior to subsequent Mediator functions. Complementary ChIP and RNAi analyses reveal that Pol II(G) is recruited to promoter regions of subsets of actively transcribed genes, where it appears to restrict transcription. These and other results suggest that Pol II(G) may act to modulate some genes while simultaneously, as a poised (noninitiated) polymerase, setting the stage for Mediator-dependent enhancement of their activity.,"
