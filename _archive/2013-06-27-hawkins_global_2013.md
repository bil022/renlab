    abstract: " Naive CD4(+) T cells can differentiate into specific helper and regulatory T cell lineages in order to combat infection and disease. The correct response to cytokines and a controlled balance of these populations is critical for the immune system and the avoidance of autoimmune disorders. To investigate how early cell-fate commitment is regulated, we generated the first human genome-wide maps  of histone modifications that reveal enhancer elements after 72 hr of in vitro polarization toward T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 (Th2) cell lineages. Our analysis indicated that even at this very early time point, cell-specific gene regulation and enhancers were at work directing lineage commitment. Further examination of lineage-specific enhancers identified transcription factors (TFs)  with known and unknown T cell roles as putative drivers of lineage-specific gene  expression. Lastly, an integrative analysis of immunopathogenic-associated SNPs suggests a role for distal regulatory elements in disease etiology.,"
